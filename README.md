## About

CoderDojo Oradea Space Robotics is an educational initiative based in Oradea, Romania, that aims to inspire and educate young people about space science, programming, and satellite technology. Our program currently focuses on CanSat competitions - where teams design, build, and launch small satellite prototypes the size of a soda can that simulate real satellite missions.

### Our Mission

To empower the next generation of space engineers and scientists by providing hands-on experience with CanSat development, data collection, and analysis in an accessible, engaging, and collaborative environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with microcontrollers (helpful but not required):
  - Arduino
  - ESP32
  - STM32
  - Raspberry Pi
- Interest in electronics, sensors, and data collection
- Enthusiasm for learning about space technology and satellite missions!
